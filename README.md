# sls-video-processing-with-fargate

A step-by-step walkthrough of building a serverless application to run a long-running process with AWS Fargate and Lambda. The app will take a video file and generate a thumbnail for a user-defined frame position.

This is a companion project to the blog post [How to build long-running serverless apps using Lambda and AWS Fargate with Stackery](https://rupakganguly.com/posts/how-to-build-long-running-serverless-apps-using-lambda-and-fargate-with-stackery/)
